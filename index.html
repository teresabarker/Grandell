    <!--h2>Welcome to My Little Corner of the Internet</h2>
    <p>Hey there, I’m Teresa, but most people call me Terry. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.</p>
    <p>Here on teresabarker.com you'll find my
        <a href="/Users/admin/Projects/Blog Templates/Grandell/pages/blog.html" target="_blank">Blog</a>,
        <a href="/Users/admin/Projects/Blog Templates/Grandell/pages/portfolio.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>, and

    <p>I used to be a tumblr girl (which, if you haven’t noticed yet, you will soon) but I decided to move over to having my own blog instead. I started this blog with the intention to have it be a place where I could have a creative outlet and connect with people along the way. I’ve always loved taking pictures, writing, and being overly sentimental about everything, so a blog just seemed like the perfect fit.</p>
    <p>I started this blog on January 1, 2018. Launching it that day was important to me because it felt like a new beginning. In a way, it was like a new year’s resolution to finally do the thing that I had been thinking about for months and months and months and just finally doing it. It was a big step for me.</p>
    <p>I’m always trying to be my best self, whatever that looks like at the time. This blog helps me do that by encouraging me to romanticize the good parts of life and by connecting with others on the not so good parts. Like I said earlier – overly sentimental about everything.</p>
    <p>That’s why as much as my blog is a place for me to share about my life, interests, struggles, and stories, I also want it to be a place where you reading this can connect with me and other people reading, too. We’re all just trying to figure life out, achieve our goals, and be better than we were yesterday – but we also want to wear a cute outfit and have fun while doing it, too.</p>
    <p>Basically, I want to just be me and do me and express that in my own little corner of the internet, and if people can dig it and connect with it then that’s awesome.</p>
