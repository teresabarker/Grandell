            <h2>Grandell</h2>
            <h3>Website built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</h4>
            <h4>Design and Development by Teresa Barker</h5>
            <h5>Behind the Name</h4>
            <p>Grandell is the website that you are on right now. The name comes from my older brother - when we were kids and playing Animal Crossing, I needed to name my town. I spent all day trying to think of a good name, only to come up short. My brother saved the day when out of the blue he goes, “What about Grandel?” Immediately I liked it. I also decided it was missing another “L”, so thus was born, Grandell.</p>
            <p>It’s what I’ve named every new Animal Crossing town and island that I’ve built from scratch in the subsequent games, and so when choosing a name for my website, the name I used to build something from the ground up felt fitting.</p>
            <h5>Technical Details</h5>
            <p>I set up hosting and the domain through <a href="https://www.siteground.com/" target="_blank">SiteGround</a>, which is also where I access the CPanel to manage the memcache and dynamic cache. The website is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS - and that code lives in a repo on <a href="https://github.com/teresabarker/Grandell" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <h2>Wireframes</h3>
            <h3>Designing the Desktop and Mobile Layouts</h3>
            <p>I used <a href="https://www.figma.com/" target="_blank">Figma</a> to create the wireframes for Grandell.</p>
            <p>You can see the (living and breathing) <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/AICZpNzb1AAyNi3s7dRXD4/Grandell-Wireframes?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=StORW7htJgHJxdec-0" target="_blank">wireframes</a> embedded here on this page. It’s been at the forefront of my mind since the beginning to design a site that both felt like it reflected who I am and was clean and easy to navigate.</p>
            <p>Of course, I had an idea of what I wanted my site to look like from previous iterations of it and elements I saw on other sites with elegant UI/UX, and so I started there. And of course, the site you’re looking at now differs drastically (thankfully) from what I thought were good design choices back in the day. Even more iterations have happened along the way as I’d bounce back and forth between design and development.</p>
            <p>In this day and age, having my site both look good and be intuitive to use on any device is crucial, so I made sure to plan out how it should look in all cases. “Mobile” also applies to tablets or shrinking the window in a desktop.</p>
            <p>It was also important to me to familiarize myself with a wire-framing tool like Figma so that one day when I was working with other developers or a team, it’d be easier to convey the ideas in my head and also ensure that we’re all on the same page with design.</p>
            <p>Also, designing something by dragging and dropping some pictures and text boxes and then actually being able to write code to make it look like that was (and still is) one of the most rewarding feelings.</p>
